# Iowa TDV Tutorials

Hello! This repository is supposed to be a guide to installing all the software
needed to follow along with the tutorial talks at [Iowa TDV
2022](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~idarcy/CONF/TDV.html?utm_source=math.uiowa.edu&utm_medium=flyer%3B+e-flyer%3Bemail&utm_campaign=TDF+2022).
It is split up into three directories, one for each day. Hopefully it all makes
sense.
