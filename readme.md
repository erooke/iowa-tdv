# Iowa TDV Tutorials

Hello! This repository is supposed to be a guide to installing all the software
needed to follow along with the tutorial talks at [Iowa TDV
2022](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~idarcy/CONF/TDV.html?utm_source=math.uiowa.edu&utm_medium=flyer%3B+e-flyer%3Bemail&utm_campaign=TDF+2022).

## Python / Anaconda

For all of the days you will need to have python / anaconda installed. If you
do not have it installed you can install it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/).

If you have other ways of managing your python versions and environments
already installed that should be fine, the rest of the instructions are written
assuming you are using anaconda however.

## Git

### Windows

Git should also be installed. If this is not installed you can install it from
[here](https://git-scm.com/download/win). It will ask you a lot of questions,
the default answers are all quite sane, you might want to change the default
text editor from vim to something you're familiar with however.

### Linux / Mac

Install git from your package manager

## Everything else

This is split into three sections for sanity

- [Mapper](mapper.md)
- [DREiMac](dreimac.md)
- [ParaView](paraview.md)
